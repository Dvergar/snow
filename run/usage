  lumen <options>

options list :
  version, help, usage, install, update, rebuild, lumen

options :

  -version
      displays the version number plainly for tools

  -usage / -help
      displays the lumen tool usage information

  help
      displays the lime-tools backend usage information, for commands that this tool
      forwards to the build tools for you when calling with any of the commands not listed
  

  -install / -update [dev|edge] [-force]
      To setup lumen for first use, run this again with -install

      Will install dependencies and setup lumen, update 
      development builds, or bleeding edge repo builds for you.
      Some options might require force to protect your changes (if any).

  -lumen path
      An explicit path for lumen sources (otherwise fetched from haxelib). 
      Used mainly for server automated builds.

  -rebuild [target] [-clean] [-arch value]
      Clean rebuilds the target from scratch.

      By default, the arch flag is not needed. 
      The best default archs will be built, these
      arch values are to help exclude builds you don't need/want.

      In other words, if you are building a linux build and don't need 32 bit
      builds, you can include the -arch 64bit flag, which excludes 32 bit builds.

      For iOS, the device flag will exclude simulator builds.

      -rebuild target = [mac, windows, linux, android, ios]
      -arch value = [32bit, 64bit, armv7, device]
