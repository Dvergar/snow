<h1>AbstractClass</h1>
<small>`snow.utils.AbstractClass`</small>

Old school abstract class.
	Classes that implements it, and their sub-classes, will be able to declare abstract methods (methods that without body).
	There will be a check in compile-time such that no public constructor is allowed without all abstract methods implemented.
