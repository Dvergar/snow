##About

snow is a light, pure and clean toolkit for building frameworks, applications and games using [haxe](http://haxe.org), targetting native platforms and browser.
This means snow by default runs natively on **Mac**, **Windows**, **Linux** desktops, as well as **iOS** and **Android** devices. It also runs directly in the **Web** browser using webgl.

&nbsp;_how?_

&nbsp;

Haxe is an expressive, beautiful modern programming language that compiles it's own code into other languages. 
This allows you, a user of haxe and thus snow - to build your code into the target platform code directly.

For example native platforms would use c++, without you ever needing to write c++ code.
Haxe exports to optimized javascript, so when you target a browser - it will run there too.

##Design

snow embraces a minimal, straight arrow approach by exposing a variety of tools at your disposal,
with as much consistency as possible across targets. This allows you to focus on yout code and not the platform code.

snow is built as a facilitator only - it is focused on portability, clarity, consistency and maintainability.
This allows you to build frameworks, games and applications without it getting in the way.

snow is also as self contained as possible.
It is built with no external dependencies, except for a build pipeline called [flow](#), which makes the application.
