##About

**snow** is a light, pure and clean toolkit for building frameworks, applications and games using [haxe](http://haxe.org), targeting native platforms and web browser.
This means snow by default runs natively on **Mac**, **Windows**, **Linux** desktops, as well as **iOS** and **Android** devices. It also runs directly in the **Web** browser using webgl.

##Beta

Please note   
The documentation is a constant work in progress and will continue to be finalized prior to 1.0.0.

snow is currently considered beta which means there may be bugs, inconsistencies or very rarely imcomplete implementations of things.
It is still considered fairly stable and is being used by multiple frameworks and games,
but there are things to tighten up before 1.0.0 release happens officially.

##Design

**snow embraces a minimal design.**   
&emsp; This means snow is to the point and does what it is designed for only.   
&emsp; This includes exposing tools to you with as much consistency as possible across platforms.   
&emsp; This allows you to focus on your code, and not platform details as much.   

**snow is built as a facilitator.**    
&emsp; This means that snow tries to avoid making assumptions, letting you decide your architecture.   
&emsp; This allows you to build frameworks, games and applications without it getting in the way.   
&emsp; This means snow is focused on portability, clarity, consistency and maintainability.   

**snow is as self contained as possible.**   
&emsp; There are no current external dependencies, except for a build pipeline called [flow](#).   

**snow strives to be reliable.**   
&emsp; There are tests of various kinds, you can read about the [testing approach]({{{rel_path}}}guide/contribute.html#tests) in the guide.

**snow has high standards.**   
&emsp; From code quality, clarity and portability to documentation to samples.
